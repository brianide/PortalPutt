# Portal Putt
A TShock plugin that allows golf balls to pass through portals.

## Details
This plugins allows golf balls to pass through portals, maintaining their relative velocity and position.

## Known Issues
* You'll sometimes notice a "fake" bounce off of portal surfaces before the ball jumps through; this can't really be fixed without a client mod, but ultimately shouldn't affect anything.
* The golf ball camera doesn't teleport with the ball over long distances and instead just tracks across the map to it. Again, this is a client issue that probably can't be fixed.
* You could probably cheat your golf score with long-distance portals if you wanted to. I'll look into fixing this at some point.
